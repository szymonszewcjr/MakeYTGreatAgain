## MakeYTGreatAgain: a chrome extension

This extension uses [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/).


The whole purpose of this extension is to bring back older modern look from before July 2022.

Give it a shot, but dont expect miracles, this is my side project and as such I don't get to spend enough time on it.

if you found any bugs feel free to create an issue.


## HOW TO INSTALL
Download whole repo as zip, unzip it and place the main folder someplace where you wont delete it, like root of your drive.

Open Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode, hit F5 to refresh tab.

Drag the main folder onto Chrome.

Extension should be installed and working by now.

Have a nice time using it
